                    I work for the University of Texas Libraries as Technical Staff. Currently,
                    I am enrolled in the University of Texas Full Stack Coding Bootcamp. I am studying <strong>HTML</strong>, 
                    <strong>CSS</strong>, and <strong>JavaScript</strong> and look forward to learning much more in the coming months. 
                    Upon completion of the program I will be looking to start a Development career here in Austin.

                    I moved to Austin in 2012 with my wife, Cynthia. We previously lived in Boston, where we met while 
                    attending Brandeis University. There I double-majored in Economics and Philosophy. I am 
                    originally from Albany, New York and still have a lot of family there.

                    My hobbies include cycling, film, pub trivia, and travel. I recently visited Mexico City for 
                    the first time and look forward to returning soon.
